      <p>
        Have you ever been told to overreacting or being "too sensitive"?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you get this feeling that your senses are constantly stimulated?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you worship your downtime as if it was the best part of your day?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do loud music and crowded places make you get irritated and overwhlemed, but at the same time you enjoy the company of your friends?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you get this feeling that everyone around has much more energy that you?
    </p>
      <p>
        ...and this sudden "I need it now" request from you boss that ruins your well-planned schedule.
      </p>
